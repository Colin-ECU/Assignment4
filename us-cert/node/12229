However, how do we communicate the value of cyber security programs and cyber security spending to our leadership? When asked the questions ‘are we doing the right things?,’ ‘are we doing them fast enough?’ are we able to articulate that story and present the value of a mature security capability in business terms, to our most senior leadership? This presentation will show the journey that started in a board room and the steps taken by the cyber security organization to answer what seemed to be simple questions. The presentation will not only feature the insights and lessons learned from ABB but also the views and challenges as seen by KPMG, the external experts that were brought in to help assess ABB’s global cyber security initiative.</div><div> </div></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 108px; height: 41px;"><div>10:20 - 11:05am</div><div>Breakout 1</div></td><td style="width: 641px; height: 41px;"><div><strong>Hacking the Power Grid: Analyzing What Hackers Do When They Have Access to the “Power Grid Honeypot”</strong></div><div>Dewan Chowdhury, MalCrawler</div><div> </div><div>The nightmarish scenario of the power grid being hacked and causing disruption to the electric grid has been used by the entertainment industry to politician to show the public the seriousness of cyber threats. Energy companies are the number one target for cyber attacks against critical infrastructure based on DHS reporting, so it is well known in the industry that hackers are trying to access the ICS/SCADA side of energy companies.  We created a honeypot that replicates the Energy Management System (EMS/SCADA) of a modern electric company. The EMS/SCADA is used by electric companies to monitor, control, and optimize power grid. The EMS/SCADA honeypot allows attacker to control key component of the power grid such as Nuclear power generator, major transmission lines that affect the BES (Bulk Electric System). We added component to mimic the Smart Grid such as distributed generation (Solar, Wind) to distributed automation.  This honeypot allows the community to understand what hacker would do if they have access to the most important system in the GRID the “EMS/SCADA”. We examine a wide variety of skill set from novice hackers to APT actors on the Honeypot. We try to understand their actions and objective. When they are controlling the grid, is it sabotage or espionage?</div><div> </div></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 108px; height: 41px;"><div>10:20 - 11:05am</div><div>Breakout 2</div></td><td style="width: 641px; height: 41px;"><div><strong>Malware Trends 2016 - Presentation Not Available</strong></div><div>Kyle McCready, Idaho National Laboratory</div><div>David Hudson, Idaho National Laboratory</div><div> </div><div>Malware Trends 2016 will discuss general trends in malware evolution to date.  This topic will cover recent developments in malware capability, tactics and techniques.  During this talk we will discuss these developments, specific examples, and recommend ways to mitigate current and future threats.  This presentation will wrap up with a question and answer session with the audience.</div><div> </div></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 108px; height: 41px;"><div>11:10 - 11:55am</div><div>Main Room</div><div> </div></td><td style="width: 641px; height: 41px;"><div><strong>Efforts to Develop Implementation Guidelines in Support of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework</strong></div><div>Kerry O’Connor, Department of Homeland Security</div><div>Sharla Artz, Schweitzer Engineering</div><div> </div><div>In February 2014, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released the voluntary “Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity” in order to provide general guidance that critical infrastructure owners and operators can leverage to better assess and manage cybersecurity risk. The Framework enables an organization—regardless of sector, size, degree of risk, or cybersecurity sophistication—to apply the principles and effective practices of cyber risk management to improve the security and resilience of its critical infrastructure. It recommends an approach that enables organizations to prioritize their cybersecurity decisions based on individual business needs, without additional regulatory requirements. The Framework is designed to complement, and not replace, an organization’s risk management process and cybersecurity program. Each sector and individual organization can use the Framework in a tailored manner to address its distinct cybersecurity risks and objectives.</div><div> </div><div>In order to position critical infrastructure owners and operators to most effectively implement the Framework, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) National Protection and Programs Directorate led an effort to develop implementation guidelines in support of the Framework. The Office of Infrastructure Protection and Office of Cybersecurity and Communications, in collaboration with public and private sector partners from six (Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Commercial Facilities, Dams, Emergency Services, and Nuclear) of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors, initiated the development of comprehensive guidance documents in order to help owners and operators implement the Framework using sector-specific tools and resources. Once finalized, these documents will be publically available and distributed using a variety of methods including the Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN). DHS will work with private sector partners to ensure these guidelines are appropriately updated to account for changes on available resources or the dynamic threat environment.</div><div> </div><div>The development of these guidance documents highlight the strength of the public-private partnership outlined in the 2013 National Infrastructure Protection Plan. This partnership model, which allows for an open dialog between DHS and the private sector to strengthen critical infrastructure security and resilience, serves as a very effective collaboration mechanism in support of a broad spectrum of efforts addressing the dynamic risk environment. The presenters will describe the sector-specific Framework implementation guidance, discuss the processes used for their development, and provide an overview of additional resources and relevant programs.</div><div> </div></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 108px; height: 41px;"><div>11:10 - 11:55am</div><div>Breakout 1</div></td><td style="width: 641px; height: 41px;"><div><strong>Stop Patching, It’s Stupid</strong></div><div>Lior Frenkel, Waterfall Security Solutions</div><div> </div><div>There is more value in ICS perimeter security, than in patching.</div><div> </div><div>Among the first security measures any industrial cybersecurity program recommends are passwords, firewalls, anti-virus systems, patching, and intrusion detection systems. These measures are costly, and backwards-looking. These controls address "last year's" set of high-frequency, low-impact (HFLI) common malware incidents and insider errors/omissions.</div><div> </div><div>How are these measures working for us? Well anti-virus often impairs safety and reliability and so can't be used everywhere. Patching is really expensive, and introduces its own safety and reliability risks, even though security measures are supposed to be defending safety and reliability. Worse, patching addresses only known vulnerabilities, and vulnerabilities are the wrong way to think about ICS security. High-impact, targeted attacks, such as the LA hospital's targeted ransomware, and the Ukrainian power outage, exploit permissions, not vulnerabilities. Conventional intrusion detection is another costly security measure that catches only some targeted attacks, months after equipment has been compromised, and long after the damage is done. None of these measures address the most common high-impact, low-frequency (HILF) attacks we see happening in the field today.</div><div> </div><div>A better way to think about security is to consider a threat spectrum and decide how high in the spectrum to "raise the bar." No security system is or ever can be perfect. Important control systems should raise the bar to just below Stuxnet-class attacks. That is: the only high-impact attack our defenses may not have a high degree of confidence in deflecting, are the most-sophisticated, autonomous, targeted attacks, which are designed to defeat one site's defenses specifically, with the active assistance of compromised insiders at the targeted site.</div><div> </div><div>Working from this "bar" down the threat model, we first address HILF attacks. We observe that important control systems all have physical and cyber-security perimeters. Perimeters may be "evaporating" in IT networks, but would we ever put our safety systems in our lobbies, or on the Internet? Of course not. Perimeters are fundamental to important control systems. For a system to change from an "uncompromised" to "compromised" state, an attack must cross a perimeter - in a message, on a USB stick, or in the head of a human actor.</div><div> </div><div>A top-down approach to security starts by deploying a strong, physical perimeter. We then deploy a strong, unidirectional, cyber perimeter. Unidirectional gateways defeat high-impact, remote-control attacks, no matter how sophisticated those attacks might be. We next deploy strong removable media and removable device controls, both technological and procedural. This eliminates another important perimeter-crossing attack vector. Industrial-focused intrusion detection systems have a role here as well, especially to alert when someone has violated these procedures.</div><div> </div><div>Last, we consider LIHF incidents at the "bottom" of the threat spectrum. Many of these incidents have been addressed by the HILF protections, but not all of them, particularly insider errors and omissions. We might still deploy some kind of password/AV/patching programs, to address LIHF incidents, but now we can compare the costs of these programs to the limited of addressing LIHF risks, and scale these costly programs appropriately.</div><div> </div><div>In summary - our goal for our important control systems should be to raise the bar to the point where the only credible, high-impact attacks are the most sophisticated, autonomous attacks, with active, deliberate cooperation from compromised insiders. With this goal in place, and a clear path to achieving it, we need only determine which of our control systems are important.</div><div> </div></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 108px; height: 41px;"><div>11:10 - 11:55am</div><div>Breakout  2</div></td><td style="width: 641px; height: 41px;"><div><strong>U.S. Department of Homeland Security Protective Security Coordination Division Overview</strong></div><div><strong> - Presentation Not Available</strong></div><div>Christine Figueroa, DHS Office of Infrastructure Protection</div><div> </div></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 108px; height: 83px;"><div>1:20 - 2:05pm</div><div>Main Room</div><div>Keynote</div></td><td style="width: 641px; height: 83px;"><div><strong>Keynote Address - Presentation Not Available</strong></div><div><strong>Gregory Touhill</strong></div><div>Deputy Assistant Secretary, Cybersecurity and Communications</div><div>U.S. Department of Homeland Security</div><div> </div><div>Brigadier General (retired) Gregory J.

The capability of cyber organizations tasked to defend critical infrastructure has been called into question by numerous cybersecurity experts.

The challenge is selecting a standard and then trying to apply it to a control systems environment at a single site or across a fleet of facilities and systems. This presentation begins by describing the traditional ‘assessment-based’ approach to ICS security, its weaknesses, and how it will struggle to “get ahead” of the problems that lead to insecure ICS. The next topic is sharing a cyber security framework that builds upon existing technical frameworks (e.g., 62443-3-3 security levels), maturity models (e.g., CMMI, MIL), and procedural frameworks (e.g., NIST CSF, 62443-2-1). Using examples, this framework is then used to benchmark the ‘current state’ of any asset owner’s ICS security program, the target state, and how to lay out a roadmap to achieve it.</div><div> </div></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 108px; height: 66px;"><div>2:10 - 2:55pm  Breakout 2</div><div>Demonstration</div><div> </div></td><td style="width: 641px; height: 66px;"><div><strong>The Stages of Cyber Attack Against ICS Networks</strong></div><div>Dario Lobozzo, Radiflow</div><div> </div><div>Cyber-attacks against ICS networks have been on the rise in recent years.

It only takes one vulnerable system to be exploited for an attacker to cause significant damage that could compromise system performance and even their operation. It is therefore essential that organizations proactively safeguard their systems with a practical set of steps that includes securing all privileged accounts existing in their networks.</div><div> </div><div>We will review important steps that organizations can take to reduce the attack surface area and take a proactive approach to the ICS security problem.  This is a key step in safeguarding critical assets given the risks associated with direct connectivity to untrusted endpoints. </div><div> </div></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 102px; height: 146px;"><div>10:45 – 11:30am</div><div>Breakout 1</div></td><td style="width: 660px; height: 146px;"><div><strong>Assessing Cybersecurity Risk</strong></div><div>Marc Ayala, aeSolutions</div><div> </div><div>Assessing cybersecurity risk is generally considered to be one of the first and most fundamental steps in any solid IACS cybersecurity management program. ISA 99.02.01 (now ISA 62443-2-1) published in 2009 includes requirements that organizations perform both high-level and detailed cybersecurity risk assessments on all identified IACSs.  These requirements were reinforced in 2014 by the NIST Cybersecurity Framework that also specifies cybersecurity risk assessments and directly references the ISA 62443 requirements.</div><div> </div><div>While both of these documents require risk assessments neither provide information regarding "how" to perform such an assessment.   Guidance on how to perform IACS cybersecurity risk assessments is now available in the recently developed ISA 62443-3-2, "Security Risk Assessment and System Design”.

Illicit access to control systems makes it possible for cyber criminals to cause physical damage to industrial systems and has the potential to affect the availability, reliability and safety of mission critical services. At the same time, the number of industrial control devices connected to the Internet continues to grow rapidly, dramatically expanding the attack surface for cyber criminals targeting these systems. These factors are making the addition of cyber security controls a priority for critical industries around the world.</div><div> </div><div>However, improving the cyber security of industrial systems without affecting availability or reliability is no small feat. One of the biggest challenges critical infrastructure organizations face as they improve cyber security capabilities is successfully bridging the gap between IT (information technology) and OT (operational technology).</div><div> </div><div>Traditionally, both IT and OT have served distinct roles – each have their own goals, technologies and business processes.

Each silo has a discipline-specific view of the environment and a discipline-specific approach to response. A 2013 sniper attack on Pacific Gas and Electric’s Metcalf substation illustrated the impact this discipline specific view can have on effective response to incidents. In the Metcalf incident, physical security monitoring indicated some anomalies but a police drive-by did not identify any specific problem. Meanwhile, operational monitoring received equipment failure alarms for the substation. Ultimately, it was determined that a gunman damage 17 transformers.</div><div>During the incident, the police responding to the physical security alert were unaware of the equipment failures. Had they known, the response may have been more thorough than a drive-by. The operators did not know there was an active shooter at the substation. They might have dispatched a line crew into harm’s way.</div><div> </div><div>The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence’s (NCCoE’s) Situational Awareness for the Energy Sector project augments existing discipline-specific situational awareness by using commercial and open-source products to collect and aggregate monitoring information from across multiple silos. The aggregated information is analyzed and relevant alerts are provided back to the discipline-specific monitoring capabilities, improving each discipline’s understanding of the environment. This, in turn, leads to more appropriate response.</div><div> </div><div>This presentation explains the approach taken to collect, aggregate, and analyze information from different disciplines.

The assessment offerings include the Cyber Security Evaluation Tool (CSET®), the Design Architecture Review (DAR), and the Network Analysis Verification and Validation (NAVV). Each type of assessment serves a different purpose. The CSET focuses on the administrative aspects of the systems lifecycle (e.g., procure, install, maintain, and dispose) by asking a series of yes and no questions. The DAR is more free-flowing in that it is a facilitated discussion of the industry partner’s network architecture. The NAVV is an analysis of the data traffic captured at key boundary points in the network. Collectively, these three assessments have given ICS-CERT a broad overview of the state of the cybersecurity of control systems that monitor and control the nation's infrastructure.</div><div> </div><div>One of the key observations made by ICS-CERT's assessment team is that the cybersecurity maturity level of the organization is often related to how well the organization knows what information is publicly available on its control system, how this information is controlled, how its system is architected, and how data flows from one node to another, especially as it crosses the ICS/IT perimeter. To simplify it, the cybersecurity maturity level of the organization is dependent on how well it knows and understands its control system and network.</div><div> </div><div>Why is this important? When a malicious actor targets a cyber system, they do extensive reconnaissance of the system using techniques like foot printing, which is a methodical process for profiling the system and scanning to learn everything they can about it.

Our demonstration will be approximately 20-30 minutes in length. Critical Infrastructure employees can learn about the specific critical infrastructure they are working at and about the systems and procedures in a safe environment. This allows workers to practice on the specific equipment in the realistic 3D simulation realm which translates to higher skill levels and improved employee performance. Highly realistic simulations allow learners to use tools like voltmeters, gas detectors, stray voltage testers, rotation meters and phase sticks to name a few, to solve realistic problems that could occur on critical infrastructure equipment in the field. 3D Simulators allows learners to make mistakes and understand the consequences without causing real injury or harm to the person or the equipment. This translates into “Saving Lives and Saving Equipment.”</div><div> </div><div>Since our technology can be used over the web, inside the organization, and on mobile devices it is very easy to deploy to large numbers of employees. The 3D simulators can be used in lunch rooms and during inclement weather conditions for continued or updated training. This type of training can eliminate travel costs, and potentially reduce time off the job. Training on a 3D simulation of your system will give employees comprehensive knowledge of how the equipment operates. The work force is aging and will be retiring. Simulations are the best way to capture knowledge to use to train the remaining and incoming work force. For example, the Utility, Fire, HazMat, Police, and EMS departments can work together to simulate an accident and see how each agency handles the mishap. The physics engine capabilities can provide accurate plume modeling for different airborne chemicals as well as explosions. Most emergencies would cost too much to simulate in real life and the simulator can be used over and over again to perfect procedures. Simulators are not only great to simulate the applications and jobs at a control center but also to prequalify employees for the job. This technology is so immersive many stresses are added into the simulations to reflect the real world situations. The simulator can be used to track each item when building an infrastructure for real-time procurement.</div><div> </div></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 102px; height: 41px;"><div>11:15am - 2:00pm</div><div>Main Room</div></td><td style="width: 647px; height: 41px;"><div><strong>Canadian Cyber Incident Response Centre Operations and Outreach - Presentation Not Available</strong></div><div>Frank Turbide, CCIRC</div><div> </div><div>CCIRC is the Canadian national computer security incident response team.

The assessment of cybersecurity posture requires evaluating security controls for effectiveness and alignment to the Framework’s five functions and associated categories. After evaluation with the Framework's structure, the Current Profile outcomes are reported to stakeholders in an understandable and repeatable format called the Cybersecurity Framework Scorecard (CFS). The Current Profile or CFS supports the subsequent Framework steps "Conduct a Risk Assessment" and "Create a Target Profile." This presentation is primarily focused on Step 3 in the Framework. The presentation describes real world experiences from assessing critical infrastructure, the NIST SP800-115 based assessment methodology, and the control scoring (ex. ISO, NIST, or ANSI/ISA 62443) that produces a Cybersecurity Framework Scorecard of critical infrastructure security.</div><div> </div></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 102px; height: 41px;"><div>11:15am - 2:00pm</div><div>Breakout 2</div></td><td style="width: 647px; height: 41px;"><div><strong>BowTie Methodology for Analyzing Cyber Footprint</strong></div><div>Bri Rolston, Monsanto</div><div>Harry Paul, OSIsoft</div><div> </div><div>OSIsoft has adapted the popular BowTie risk assessment methodology, typically used to analyze safety, to examine the Cyber profile of software installations.  Utilize this methodology to: visualize the Cyber footprint throughout a network, follow the kill chain from corporate presence to control system, drill down through attack vectors and defenses, explore system compromise and evaluate impact reduction and adapt the model to a changing architecture.  Bri Rolston, an ICS Security Lead, will share her perspective on this technique and how she has used it to visualize and analyze problems in actual manufacturing networks.</div><div> </div></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 102px; height: 53px;"><div>1:20 - 2:05pm</div><div>Main Room</div></td><td style="width: 647px; height: 53px;"><div><strong>Protecting What Matters in the United Kingdom - Presentation Not Available</strong></div><div>Matt B, CPNI</div><div> </div></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 102px; height: 76px;"><div>1:20 - 2:05pm</div><div>Breakout 1</div></td><td style="width: 647px; height: 76px;"><div><strong>Arizona Cyber Warfare Range (AZCWR) is Providing a Barrier-Free Opportunity to Become Security Savvy</strong></div><div>Brett Scott, Arizona Cyber Warfare Range</div><div>Raymond Rivera, Arizona Cyber Warfare Range</div><div> </div><div>The United States has found itself behind the technology curve when it comes to securing its digital information.

Most Security-focused education curriculums are focused on the theory and standards of computer fundamentals and Information Management.   However, the small group of volunteers in the Desert Southwest that facilitate AZCWR still believe in learning by doing and have created the AZCWR to give security professionals, and the non-professionals alike, the opportunity to “learn by doing,” in fact to “learn by destruction.”</div><div> </div><div>AZCWR is one of largest volunteer staffed organizations in the country focused on innovation and education in cyber security. The range allows members to actively engage in “live fire” Computer Network Attacks (CNA) against a wide variety of platforms. The range is a no-holds-barred environment.
